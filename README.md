# nd-dumping

Welcome to the Night Dream Development github.
This script is for qb-core. It is important to know that you will need two things to run this script. 
First:
-QB-Core framework from: https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core
-PS-UI from: https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-ui

# The installation instructions for ps ui

It can be found at the bottom of the github page.
i.e. I'll help you... Just install it. Rename it (delete the -master text) and copy it to the [standalone] folder.  From now on you don't have to do anything else because it will start by itself on every server restart. 

Once that's done, install my script, which is also the same way. 
And you can use my script. 

I also recommend a factory progressbar modification:

of course you can also install it in the readme section of the script.

Have fun!
